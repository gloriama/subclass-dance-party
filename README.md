# subclass-dance-party
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Introduction

This is an underwater-themed game, inspired by Pac-Man.



Use A (left), W (up), D (right), and S (down) to control your player. Eat other dots to increase your size!

## Set-Up

After cloning and cding into the repo, simply run ```open dancefloor.html``` from the terminal to open the game in your default web browser.

## Tech Stack

This is a purely front-end project that uses jQuery.
